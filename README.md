# ConnectFour

Connect Four is a game where two players alternate turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid. Each player uses a different color (usually red or yellow), and the objective of the game is to be the first player to get four discs in a row.
 

To create a game UI, I followed a Kaggle.com tutorial on Game AI and Reinforcement Learning: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-game-ai-and-reinforcement-learning

For this project, I created the UI using the pyhon's tkinter Library, where the Board class is responsible for imlementing the UI functionality.

The computerAI.py file contains functions used to implement different AI strategies (Like one-step lookahead, random, and N-step lookahead)
